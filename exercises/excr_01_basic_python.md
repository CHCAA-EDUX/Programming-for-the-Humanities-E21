# Exercises for Basic Python Lesson #

Solve the following 'pair programming', 'Check your understanding', and 'practice questions' in groups of two or four.

## Pair programming ##

In pairs (one writes code, the other comment) write a program, `hello.py` that that says hello and asks for name, and print the name and length of name to the terminal.

## Check your understanding ##

1: What values do the variables `mass` and `age` have after each of the following statements? Test your answer by executing the lines.

```py
1 mass = 47.5
2 age = 122
3 mass = mass * 2.0
4 age = age - 20
```

2: Sorting Out References. Python allows you to assign multiple values to multiple variables in one line by separating the variables and values with commas. What does the following program print out?

```py
first, second = 'James', 'Kirk'
third, fourth = second, first
print(third, fourth)
```

3: Seeing Data Types. What are the data types of the following variables?

```py
planet = 'Earth'
apples = 5
distance = 10.5
```

## Practice questions ##

1: Which of the following are operators, and which are values?

```py
*
'hello'
-88.8
-
/
+
5
```

2: Which of the following is a variable, and which is a string?

```py
spam
'spam'
```

3: Name three data types

4: What is an expressions made up of? What fo all expressions do?

5: What is a statement, e.g., assignment statement `var = 10`?

6: what does the variable `spock` contain in the following code?

```py
spock = 20
spock + 1
```

7: What should the following two expressions evaluate to?

```py
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
```

8: Why is `spock` a valid variable name and 100 invalid?

9: What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point numner, string version of a value?
