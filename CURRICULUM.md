# PftH21 Curriculum #

## Lessons 1-13 ##

Each lesson consists of two elements:

1. Lecture, introduces a programming topic through a short presentation followed by a code-along session
2. Coding Café, are used for additional programming topics not directly related to Python (e.g., version control, bash scripting), research talks, and excercises/assignments.

### Lesson 1: File Management and Interactive Programming ###

Introduces the imperative and procedural programming paradigms with Python. Topics included are basic math operators, variable assignment, PEP8, basic error handling.

#### Coding Café: Basic Unix ####

Using the Unix shell (command line interpreter) and terminal (text input/output environment) is an important tool for file managment, automation and client-server communication. This café will introduce basic commands and shell scripting.

### Lesson 2: Control Flow

Introduces how to regulate the order in which a Python program's code executes. In programming, control flow is regulated by conditional statements, loops and function calls.

#### Coding Café: Basic Unix

In this coding café, we continue with the Unix shell and terminal focusing on automation and workflows.

### Lesson 3: Functions and Modular Programming ###

Functions are bundles of organized and reusable code that run when called and require data and parameter (in most cases) that are used to control how a program's code executes. This lesson teaches modular programming focusing on the use of functions. In modular programming, we split code into seperate parts (i.e., modules) that are stored in seperate source files and can be reused across your projects.

#### Coding Café: Version Control ####

Version control with git is an invaluable tool for every coder, extending it with online repositories and social coding through GitHub completes the toolbox.

### Lesson 4: Lists and Dictionaries ###

Data type is an important concept in programming. Variables store data in different types that have type-specific methods associated with them. Python have multiple built-in data types, you have used simple data types like `str`, `int`, and `float` in the previous lessons; in this lesson we look at container-like data types that can be used to store and manipulate simple data types.

### Lesson 5: String Manipulation ####

A string is a sequence of characters (character is a symbol). In Python 3, as in many other programming languages, strings, data type `str`, are arrays of bytes that represent unicode characters. In this lesson, we will look at string manipulation, which is the process of changing, parsing, splicing, pasting, or analyzing strings.

### Lesson 6: Pattern Matching with Regex ###

A regular expression (regex for short) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. In Python, as in many other programming langauges, regex patterns can be used with string-searching algorithms for `find` and `replace` that allow you to extend Python's string manipulation capacity. In the lessons, we will learn how to apply regex classes and formulte user-specific search patterns.

### Lesson 7: Classes and Object-Oriented Programming


#### Coding Café: Fun with Classes and OOP

Object oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm used to structure a program into bundles of related properties and behaviors into individual objects. Python classes provide all the standard features of OOP (inheritance mechanism, derived classes that override methods of base class, method call of base class). This lesson will teach you how to use OOP in Python to write a strategic code base that can be used and re-used across multiple projects.

### Lesson 11: Introduction to Machine Learning and AI

Machine learning is an approach to programming that use data and learning systems to train algorithms (instead of specifying discrete steps in a programming space). This lesson is predominantly theoretical and will explain learning methods in machine learning as well as challenges such as black-box models and parity issues.
