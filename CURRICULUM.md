# PftH21 Curriculum #

## Lessons 1-13 ##

Each lesson consists of two elements:

1. Lecture, introduces a programming topic through a short presentation followed by a code-along session
2. Coding Café, are used for additional programming topics not directly related to Python (e.g., version control, bash scripting), research talks, and excercises/assignments.

### Lesson 1: File Management and Interactive Programming ###

Introduces the imperative and procedural programming paradigms with Python. Topics included are basic math operators, variable assignment, PEP8, basic error handling.

#### Coding Café: Basic Unix ####

Using the Unix shell (command line interpreter) and terminal (text input/output environment) is an important tool for file managment, automationand client-server communication. This café will introduce basic commands and shell scripting.

### Lesson 2: Control Flow

Introduces how to regulate the order in which a Python program's code executes. In programming, control flow is regulated by conditional statements, loops and function calls.

### Lesson 3: Functions and Modular Programming ###

Functions are bundles of organized and reusable code that run when called and require data and parameter (in most cases) that are used to control how a program's code executes. This lesson teaches modular programming focusing on the use of functions. In modular programming, we split code into seperate parts (i.e., modules) that are stored in seperate source files and can be reused across your projects.
